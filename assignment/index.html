    <ol>
      <li>Not exactly a questions, but I'm struggling with understanding how to write out "for loops" correctly and check values or set the index within the problem. I actually did a "for of" loop on question 6, but then saw that was the stretch goal and had to redo it. The logic of "for of" makes more sense to me.</li>
      <li>Again, not a question, but a struggle I'm identifying... especially in while and for loops I can have all the pieces in front of me, but still not see that I have them already. Transforming words into numbers (for example when accessing values in an array) takes my brain a lot of time to figure out. I'm getting a grasp of it, and it's been helpful to have someone else help me have the format of the problem click in my brain. Almost every time, it's far easier than the way I'm going about it, and there's a simpler solution I miss the first few times I attempt a problem.</li>
